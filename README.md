# Hospital_Emergency_Room_Dashboard
📊 Hospital Emergency Room Dashboard | Excel Analytics Project

I designed an interactive Hospital Emergency Room (ER) Dashboard using Microsoft Excel, focusing on transforming raw healthcare data into clear, actionable insights for better decision-making.

 Data Used:  <a href="https://github.com/shubhamshankar07/Hospital_Emergency_Room_Dashboard/blob/main/Raw%20data.xlsx">Dataset Link</a>

🔍 Key insights included in the dashboard:

🧑‍⚕️ Number of Patients
• Tracks the total number of patients visiting the ER daily
• Uses area sparklines to identify busy days and seasonal trends

⏱ Average Wait Time
• Measures how long patients wait to see a medical professional
• Highlights days with longer wait times that may require process improvements

⭐ Patient Satisfaction Score
• Monitors daily average satisfaction levels
• Helps link service quality drops to peak hours or workload pressure

🏥 Patient Admission Status
• Comparison of admitted vs. not admitted patients
• Helps understand ER workload and hospital capacity

👶👵 Patient Age Distribution
• Groups patients by age categories
• Identifies which age groups visit the ER most frequently

⏳ Timeliness of Care
• Percentage of patients seen within 30 minutes
• Evaluates ER efficiency and response time

🚻 Gender-wise Analysis
• Breakdown of patients by gender
• Useful for demographic-based planning

🏬 Department Referrals
• Shows which departments receive the most ER referrals
• Supports staffing and resource allocation decisions

This project strengthened my understanding of Excel dashboards, healthcare analytics, and KPI-driven reporting.
I’m actively building more real-world analytics projects and would really appreciate feedback from the community.
