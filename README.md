# Hospital_Emergency_Room_Dashboard
📊 Hospital Emergency Room Dashboard | Excel Analytics Project

I designed an interactive Hospital Emergency Room (ER) Dashboard using Microsoft Excel, focusing on transforming raw healthcare data into clear, actionable insights for better decision-making.

 Data Used:  <a href="https://github.com/shubhamshankar07/Hospital_Emergency_Room_Dashboard/blob/main/Raw%20data.xlsx">Dataset Link</a>

🔍 Key insights included in the dashboard:

🧑‍⚕️ Number of Patients
:-Tracks the total number of patients visiting the ER daily
and Uses area sparklines to identify busy days and seasonal trends

⏱ Average Wait Time
:-Measures how long patients wait to see a medical professional
and Highlights days with longer wait times that may require process improvements

⭐ Patient Satisfaction Score
:-Monitors daily average satisfaction levels
and Helps link service quality drops to peak hours or workload pressure

🏥 Patient Admission Status
:- Comparison of admitted vs. not admitted patients
and Helps understand ER workload and hospital capacity

👶👵 Patient Age Distribution
:- Groups patients by age categories
and Identifies which age groups visit the ER most frequently

⏳ Timeliness of Care
:- Percentage of patients seen within 30 minutes
and Evaluates ER efficiency and response time

🚻 Gender-wise Analysis
:- Breakdown of patients by gender
and Useful for demographic-based planning

🏬 Department Referrals
:- Shows which departments receive the most ER referrals
and Supports staffing and resource allocation decisions

This project strengthened my understanding of Excel dashboards, healthcare analytics, and KPI-driven reporting.
I’m actively building more real-world analytics projects and would really appreciate feedback from the community.
